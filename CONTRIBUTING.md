# Contributing to ZEBRA
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [EPL-2.0 License](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Opening GitHub [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a bug or request a new feature by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy! Please follow one of the given issue templates so that we have a consistent format.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use the [Airbnb Standard Styling](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for our TypeScript code. We enforce this through the use of ESLint, Prettier, and Husky. This means that you will be unable to commit and push code that does not pass the linting. We recommend using VSCode and its ESLint extension to format the code automatically on save.
